The project is to design a game which there are some spaceships in the map that are your enemy. They took our allies as hostages and we aim to save our allies. You can shoot whoever you want but remember if you want to win the game, you have to kill all your enemies and AVOID shooting your allies. Try it once and you'll get how to play. you can also change the map by changing map.txt.(compare the given map to graphical design and you'll understand how to change it) This game is implemented using cpp multifiles and Object Oriented Programming and Inheritence.
